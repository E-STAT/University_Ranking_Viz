## Data Story To Be Told

The Story of this analysis is guided by the following objectives:

* Analyze the dominance distribution of universities across countries for the top 100 universities in the world.
* Identify universities that have been rising tremendously over the years and also analyze the reduction of dominance of some universities, especially in the US and UK.
* Examine the top 5 universities that have been rising tremendously over the years and understand their strategy for improving.
* Identify Top 6 countries and top 10 universities that admit international students

## Thought Process

The global university rankings have become an important measure of the performance and competitiveness of universities across the world. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding the dominance distribution of universities across countries and identifying the universities that have been rising tremendously over the years. Such analysis helps to identify the strategies that universities use to improve their rankings and provides insights into the factors that contribute to their success.

In addition, there has been a growing interest in understanding the internationalization of higher education and identifying the countries and universities that admit the most international students. Understanding this trend is important for policymakers and universities seeking to attract more international students and enhance their global reputation.

To this end, this paper aims to analyze the global university rankings and identify the universities that have been rising tremendously over the years. Specifically, we will focus on the top 100 universities in the world and examine the dominance distribution of universities across countries. We will also analyze the reduction of dominance of some universities, especially in the US and UK. Additionally, we will focus on the top 5 universities that have been rising tremendously over the years and understand their strategies for improving.

Furthermore, we will analyze the top 6 countries and top 10 universities that admit international students. This analysis will provide insights into the countries and universities that are most successful in attracting international students and the factors that contribute to their success.

To achieve these goals, we will create a dashboard analysis that includes multiple pages. The first page will show the dominance distribution of universities across countries for the top 100 universities in the world. The second page will show universities that have been rising tremendously over the years and the reduction of dominance of some universities, especially in the US and UK. The third page will focus on the top 5 universities that have been rising tremendously over the years and their strategies for improving. The fourth page will analyze the top 6 countries and top 10 universities that admit international students.



## Algorithm and Library Used

For the purpose of this analysis, the following tools/libraries are used:

* **Microsoft Power BI**: A business analytics service that provides interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities with an interface simple enough for end users to create their own reports and dashboards.

* **Python**: A popular programming language used for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing.

    * **NumPy**: A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions.

    * **Pandas**: A library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures for efficiently storing large datasets and tools for working with them.

    * **StatsModel**: A library for statistical modeling and testing. It includes a range of regression models, hypothesis tests, and other statistical methods.

        * **OLS**: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is a method for estimating the parameters in a linear regression model. The OLS formula is:

        ```
        y = Xβ + ε
        ```

        where y is the dependent variable, X is a matrix of explanatory variables, β is a vector of coefficients, and ε is the error term. The OLS method estimates the values of β that minimize the sum of the squared errors (ε) between the predicted values of y and the actual values of y. This is done by finding the values of β that satisfy the normal equations:

        ```
        (X'X)β = X'y
        ```

        where X' is the transpose of X. The solution to this equation is:

        ```
        β = (X'X)^(-1)X'y
        ```

* **Microsoft Power Point**: A presentation program used to create slideshows, usually for business or educational purposes.
